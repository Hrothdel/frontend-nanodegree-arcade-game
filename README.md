# Classic arcade game clone
This is a small project I've been assigned during a web development course, and most of the resources have been given to me from the start (all the pictures and most of the code). All my work on this project is related to the game logic and its implementation.

The game is quite bare-bones, the goal of this assignment being only to make it playable, and make additions according to the given specifications.

## How to play
When the game starts, the player is placed on the bottom row of the game area. The goal of the game is to reach the top row (marked with water blocks) while avoiding the enemies that spawn on the three stone rows.

All the controls consist only of the four directional (arrow) keys, 'wasd' being also supported.

## Running the game
In case you are unfamiliar with GitHub, or with web-apps, just follow these steps:

1. Click the green "Clone or download" button, and chose "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the files anywhere on your drive.
3. Find the "index.html" file just inside the extracted folder, and run it using your browser.
